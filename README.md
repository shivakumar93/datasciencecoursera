###COURSE PROJECT :  GETTING AND CLEANING DATA

This is the course project for the getting and cleaning data lesson of the Johns Hopkins course in coursera.com. 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The code that tidies the data is stored in the run_analysis.r file. 

codebook.md describes the variables, the data, and all the transformations and work that was performed to clean up the data.

The tidied data is stored in the Tidy-Data.txt file
